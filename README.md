# Point-Cloud-Registration-and-Analysis
The repository mainly focuses on collecting recent works on point cloud registration, for sharing and better learning. Since many other tasks, like image matching and point cloud processing, are highly related to point cloud registration, these papers will be taken into account as well. In order to have a clear look at these fields, We simply classified the articles.This repository will continue to be updated.

labels of task: [cla.] for classfication, [reg.] for registration, [gen.] for shape generation, [nor.] for normal estimation
